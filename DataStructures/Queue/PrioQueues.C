// Priority Queues
// Dequeues the element with the highest priority
// 1 - highest priority

// There are two methods to implement priority queues where every number is its
// own priority
// 1. Insert all elements in the queue and then dequeue them in order of
// priority (by searching)
// insert = O(1), delete = O(n)

// 2. Insert all elements in the queue and then dequeue them in order of
// priority (by sorting and placing them in the order of priority and dequeing
// the last element)
// insert = O(n), delete = O(1)
